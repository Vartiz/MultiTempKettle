the plan is to install a PCB ring on the bottom of the kettle to pass the temperature of the water, idealy use at least 2 probes (pico has 3 ADCs);
on the ring there will be a common GND for all probes, and each track will be the reading of each probe.

the base will have spring contacts the will mate with the ring on the kettle, the uC will control the temperature via a NC Solid State Relay
this will be done in this away so the just boil will work the same away as before;

the uC will have an encoder to select the temperature, a 2 digit 7 segment display, leds to signify the end of the heat cicle,
and maybe some buttons and leds to have quick selection.

the plan is to use a Raspberry Pi pico as uC, programed in C
